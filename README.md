# Featured Events Page

A responsive single-page website showcasing crypto events worldwide. The page features a navigation bar, a hero section, and a "Featured Events" section with 3 event cards, including a search bar to filter events by name and dynamic event data rendering. Built with modern web technologies, the site is mobile- and tablet-friendly, meeting the requirements for a clean, interactive UI.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Page structure.
- **React**: Component-based architecture for dynamic UI.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Responsive and utility-first styling.
- **JavaScript**: Search functionality and dynamic event rendering.
- **Lucide-React**: Icons for event cards and search bar.
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server for fast development.
